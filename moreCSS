<em>Where Art meets tourists</em>
</div>

  <div id="ourmission"><h2> Our mission </h2>
    <p> To connect and empower local artists, hotel owners and tourists</p>
</div>

<div id="imageone">

</div>

<div id="whatwedo">
  <h2> What we do </h2>
    <p> We create <em>contemporary take-away exhibitions</em> in hotels</p>
    <p> Have you ever thought this over: often
    local artists do not have a place where to exhibit, hotel owners do not know what to put on the walls of their rooms,
    and tourists mistake mass produced imported garbage for local souvenirs.</p>
   <p> We have (many times!). The creation of contemporary take-away exhibitions is how we kill three birds with a stone. </p>
</div>


<div id="howitworks">
  <h2> How does it work, exactly?!</h2>
    <p> The platform that we are building, Arthur, will match hotel owners with local artists.
    Artists will send their work to hotel owners.
    They will use it to decorate guest rooms in a unique way. </p>
    <p> Then, the fun part starts: at the end of the stay, guests to the hotel will be able
    to <em>take the work of art and pack it</em>. Yes that's it: if you are a guest and liked the art in your room, just take it home with you!
    </p>
    <p> Does that come with a cost? We'd like to suggest free price.
    Give as much as you want to support a local artist and like their work!</p>
</div>

<div id="localartists">
  <h2>What do we mean by local artists?</h2>
  <p> There is no school course that you can follow, at the end of which you earn an Artist certificate.
  For us, they are artist because they make a ring bell. They are people in the closest geographical proximity who paint, draw, sketch, photo-shop, do graffiti and more.
  Maybe they published a couple of their work on Instagram.
  Often they are unknown and unsupported, and with Arthur we want to bring their potential to the surface.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="so">
  <h2> So, this is the deal:</h2>
    <p> If you are a local artist, you finally get a place where to exhibit your work, better than your Instagram wall.
    Oh, also you make cash. </p>
    <p> If you are a hotel owner, you have not to worry about blank walls,
    and you can offer your guests a unique concept.
    </p>
    <p> If you are a tourist, you can finally bring back home a decent souvenir
    (maybe one that does not destroy the local economy) and support local artists.
